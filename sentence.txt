We're no strangers to love. You know the rules and so do I. A full commitment is what I'm thinking of. You wouldn't get this from any other guy. I just want to tell you how I'm feeling. I'm going to have to make you understand.
I know you love me. I know you care. Just shout whenever, and I'll be there. You are my love, you are my heart. And we will never, ever, ever be apart. Are we an item? Girl, quit playin' "We're just friends." What are you saying? said, "There's another," and looked right in my eyes. My first love broke my heart for the first time, and I was like a baby.
So, what do you want to do? What's your point of view? There's a party soon. Do you want to go? A handshake with you What's your point of view? I'm on top of you. I don't want to go because I really want to stay at your house. I hope this works out. But you know how much you broke me apart? I'm done with you and will ignore you.
I'm at a payphone attempting to call home. I spent all of my change on you. Where has the time gone? Baby, it's all wrong Where are the plans we made for two? If "happy ever after" did exist, I would still be holding you like this And all those fairy tales are full of shit One more fucking love song, I'll be sick Now I'm at a payphone.
I’m in love with the shape of you. We push and pull like a magnet does. Although my heart is falling too, I’m in love with your body Last night you were in my room, and now my bed sheets smell like you Every day, I discover something brand new I’m in love with your body.

I will always remember the day you kissed my lips light as a feather, and it went just like this No, it's never been better In the summer of 2002, we were only 11 But acting like grown-ups Like we are in the present Drinking from plastic cups singing, "Love is forever and ever." Well, I guess that was true Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods On an old Mustang, where we sang songs with all our childhood friends, and it went like this, say
You were the shadow of my light Did you feel us Another start You fade away I am afraid our aim is out of sight. Want to see us alive? Where are you now  Was it all just a fantasy Where are you now Were you only imaginary Where are you now Atlantis Under the sea Where are you now Another dream The monsters are running wild inside of me I'm faded So lost These shallow waters never met What I needed I'm letting go, a deeper dive Eternal silence of the sea I'm breathing Alive
I don't want to need your love I just want to be deep in your love, and it's killing me when you're away Ooh baby 'Cause I really don't care where you are I just want to be there where you are And I gotta get one little taste Sugar, yes please. Won't you come and put it down on me? I'm right here, 'cause I need Little love, a little sympathy Yeah, you show me good love, make it alright. I need a little sweetness in my life Your sugar, yes please. Won't you come and put it down on me?
It's been a long day without you, my friend And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again We've come a long way from where we began Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again When I see you again
Sometimes I wish that I could just quit, but then the other times there's nobody better than you, even though you never listen and you're always right. I guess I would've never fit your type Except for that first night We're two kids under that moonlight We ate McDonalds at midnight and became the best of friends. I remember our first time in Barcelona That morning I was so hungover that I never thought that all roads led to this, so give me a kiss.
You know what I'm thinking? See it in your eyes You hate that you want me. You hate it when you cry You're scared to be lonely, especially in the night. I'm scared that I'll miss you. It happens every time I don't want this feeling. I can't afford love. I try to find a reason to pull us apart It ain't workin', because you're perfect, and I know that you're worth it. I can't walk away, oh
Cause sometimes I look into her eyes and that's where I find a glimpse of us And I try to fall for her touch, but I'm thinking of the way it was said I'm fine and said I moved on. I'm only here passing time in her arms, hoping I'll find a glimpse of us.
Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy But here's my number, so call me, maybe And all the other boys try to chase me But here's my number, so call me, maybe Before you came into my life, I missed you so badly. I missed you so badly. I missed you so, so badly. Before you came into my life, I missed you so badly. And you should know that, so call me maybe
